# SimGliderControl - Print Instructions

## Step 4: 3D Printing the Control Panels

### Print Settings Overview
These are the main cosmetic panel parts that form the visible cockpit interface.
I prefer a rough print plate for a good finish

### Panel Components - Standard Settings
**Material:** PLA (black or color of your choice)  
**Layer Height:** 0.2 mm  
**Perimeters:** 3  
**Infill Density:** 15%  
**Support:** None

**Parts to print:**
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-Back` *(see note below if too large for your print bed)*
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-Bottom`
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-FlapsSpoiler`
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-Front`
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-ScaleAS33`
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-Top`
- 1× `GliderCtrPanel_v1-Trim`

**Print Notes:** 
- All parts should match in color for a cohesive look
- Black recommended for authentic cockpit appearance
- Quality surface finish is important as these are highly visible parts

### Large Part Handling

**GliderCtrPanel_v1-Back:**
If this part doesn't fit your print plate, you have two options:
1. **Cut and print in 2-3 parts** - Join parts after printing with glue or screws
2. **Print diagonally cutet parts** - Rotate 45° to maximize bed usage

### Optional Multi-Material Decals

For enhanced realism, you can use multi-material printing with the following decals:

**Decal Files:**
- `Decals/as33flasp.svg` - for GliderCtrPanel_v1-FlapsSpoiler
- `Decals/logo2.svg` - for GliderCtrPanel_v1-Front
- `Decals/as33scal.svg` - for GliderCtrPanel_v1-ScaleAS33
- `Decals/as33Trim.svg` - for GliderCtrPanel_v1-Trim

**Multi-Material Printing:**
- Import SVG decals into your slicer
- Use contrasting color (white on black recommended)
- Set decal depth to 0.2-0.4 mm for best visibility
- Not required but adds professional cockpit appearance

### LED Lighting Feature

**GliderCtrPanel_v1-Front** includes a cutout designed for LED strip backlighting:
- The cutout allows LED strips to illuminate panel markings
- Use with translucent filament or decals for best effect
- LED installation covered in assembly instructions

**Next Step:** Once all panel parts are printed and finished, proceed to Step 5: Handle and Knob Components.
