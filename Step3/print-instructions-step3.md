# SimGliderControl - Print Instructions

## Step 3: 3D Printing the Enclosure and Panel

### Print Settings Overview
These cosmetic parts can be printed in your preferred color to match your cockpit setup.
I prefer to print this on a rough print plate for a good finish

### Enclosure Components - Standard Settings
**Material:** PLA (black or color of your choice)  
**Layer Height:** 0.2 mm  
**Perimeters:** 4  
**Infill Density:** 15%  
**Support:** None

**Parts to print:**
- 1× `GliderCtrEnclosureAux_v1-Enclosure`

**AND choose ONE panel option:**
- 1× `GliderCtrEnclosureAux_v1-PanelSimple` *(basic version, no auxiliary controls)*

**OR**
- 1× `GliderCtrEnclosureAux_v1-PanelFull` *(with cutouts for auxiliary switches and LEDs)*

**Print Notes:** 
- Choose a color that matches or complements your sim cockpit
- Black is recommended for a professional look
- The panel choice is NOT permanent - you can reprint and swap panels later

### Panel Selection Guide

**PanelSimple:**
- Clean, minimalist design
- No auxiliary controls
- Best for basic flaps/spoilers/trim/ballast operation
- easy built

**PanelFull:**
- Includes cutouts for switches and LEDs
- Allows future expansion without reprinting enclosure
- Recommended if you plan to add auxiliary controls later

### Before You Continue
- Check that panel fits smoothly into the enclosure
- Verify that all cutouts (if using PanelFull) are clean and free from strings
- Test the finish quality
