# SimGliderControl - Print Instructions

## Step 2: 3D Printing the Carriage Components

### Carriage Parts - Standard Settings
**Material:** PETG  (black or dark color)
**Layer Height:** 0.2 mm  
**Perimeters:** 4  
**Infill Density:** 50%  
**Support:** None

**Parts to print:**
- 1× `GliderCtrCarriage_v1-DetendHolder` *(optional: 2× for spoilers and trim, If you plan to add another smoother feedback to your spoilers and trim controls)*
- 3× `GliderCtrCarriage_v1-FixedGuide`
- 3× `GliderCtrCarriage_v1-FlexGuide`
- 1× `GliderCtrCarriage_v1-KnobMount` *(for trim control)*

**Print Notes:** 
- PETG is recommended for these parts due to its flexibility and durability under repeated movement
- The FlexGuides benefit from PETG's slight flexibility for smooth operation
- All parts should be printed in the same orientation as shown in the STL,3MF files

**Support:** All (partially)
- 2× `GliderCtrCarriage_v1-HandleMount` (3mf file include the partially support setup)
