## Building Your SimGliderControl

### 3D Printing Instructions
Follow these step-by-step printing guides to create all necessary components:

1. **[Step 1: Base Components](Step1/Print_Instructions-Step1.md)** - Foundation parts including guide shafts, linear guides, and mounting brackets
2. **[Step 2: Carriage Components](Step2/Print_Instructions-Step2.md)** - Moving parts including guides, handle mounts, and detent holders
3. **[Step 3: Enclosure and Panel](Step3/Print_Instructions-Step3.md)** - Housing and control panel options
4. **[Step 4: Control Panel](Step4/Print_Instructions-Step4.md)** - Main cockpit interface panels with optional decals and LED lighting
5. **[Step 5: Handles and Controls](Step5/Print_Instructions-Step5.md)** - Ergonomic handles, trim knob, and release mechanisms
